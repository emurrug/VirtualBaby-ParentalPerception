title: "Analyzing Virtual Baby (stable Rmd script)"
date: "5/1/2021 (re-visited on 10/09/2023)"
output: word_document
---

### Brief Description of Document
*This document is a stable markdown file that allows me to reproduce analyses and figures in report form. The most up to date raw data is currently being stored on GitHub at BabyLab/VirtualBaby-ParentPerception.*

*Note: By distributing the raw .Rmd file, one can use* `include=TRUE` *to include output, or* `echo=TRUE` *to include code. i.e., this report can be catered to different audiences without changing any of the contents. To generate a word output of the results, you can "knit" this file immediately.*

**Virtual Baby (VB)** has 2 main hypotheses: 

* Parents are more likely to rate oncoming threats (a car) as moving faster than non-parents
* Parents are more likely to detect oncoming threats faster than non-parents

## Setting up
*Hidden code*: To import necessary R packages and files. Files are pulled from local clone of GitHub repository.
```{r library, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#library
library(knitr)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr) #please do not load plyr!
library(tidyr)
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
library(emmeans)
library(lme4)
library(ggridges)
library(lmerTest)
```

```{r df, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#yes...it's on my desktop
df <- read.csv("C:/Users/emmam/Documents/GitHub/VirtualBaby-ParentPerception/Data Analysis/V1.0CrawlingOnly/precleaned_virtualbabydata_09.08.21.csv")
demos <- read.csv("C:/Users/emmam/Documents/GitHub/VirtualBaby-ParentPerception/Data Analysis/V1.0CrawlingOnly/precleaned_qualtricsdemosdata_09.08.21.csv")
```

## Cleaning The Data (Pre-Processing)
*Description:* These were the steps taken to get the data in the right format for analysis. The original raw data is not included on GitHub for participant privacy reasons.

* The `df` file was pre-cleaned from the raw download by removing pilots (before 02.18.21), and removing P56 due to technical difficulties
* The `demos` file was pre-cleaned by removing pilots, asd well as adding in subject ID and Condition 

*Hidden Code*: For the following process

* Remove non-trial blocks (Registration and Tutorial Blocks)
* Relabel blocks from Unity output to more interpretable names
* Creating a unique identifier per trial within subject 
* Creating sum variables for PROMIS scores (depression & anxiety)
* Reducing demos to vars of interest (age, gender, race, primary_language, anxiety, depression, videogames, relationship, number_children, baby_mobility, breastfeed)
* Merging `df` and `demos` (combined long- and wide-format datasheet)

```{r clean, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(block = recode_if(block, is.na(df$babylocation) == TRUE & 
                             df$block == "4.NeutralScene", 
                           "4.NeutralScene" = "block1"),
         block = recode_if(block, is.na(df$babylocation) == FALSE & 
                             df$block == "4.NeutralScene",

                             df$block == "6.BabyScene", 
                           "6.BabyScene" = "block2"))

df <-df %>% mutate ("uniquecode" = paste(subcondition, id, trial, carspeed, block))
```


```{r merge, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

  mutate('depression' = PROMIS_9 + PROMIS_10 + PROMIS_11
         + PROMIS_12 + PROMIS_13 + PROMIS_14 + PROMIS_15 + PROMIS_16)

#(easy to add more as needed, just be sure to change the loop below too)

## Descriptives of Main DV's

### Reaction Time (Threat *Detection*)
**Description**: This DV reflects time from car onset to first SPACE PRESSED (i.e., RT to car detection). Notably, it does not measure error time, because participants have freedom to move their cameras and there are also some obstacles obscuring the car at start. It is only a measure of RT that can be compared between groups. 

*Hidden code*: to describe the following

* Isolating "true" trials to be kept for analysis, meaning that each trial has only one instance of "Car Start", "Space Pressed" and "Car End" each
* Representing missed and spammed trials
* Calculate speed for "Car Start" - "Space Pressed" (RT)


```{r isolatingtruetrials, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#isolating a variable I can use for later (Bpresses) before changing what df is
df_pretrues <- df

#isolating the three critical events of each trial so that we have ONLY 3 per trial
#the 3 critical events are selected by removing other instances in the same trial in later rows
df_scores <- df %>% filter(givenevent == "Score (Space Pressed)")
df_carstart <- df %>% filter(givenevent == "Car Starts")
df_carend <- df %>% filter(givenevent == "Car Ends")

#df of just the first unique instance of each event
df_uniquescores <- df_scores %>% distinct(givenevent, uniquecode, .keep_all = TRUE)
df_uniquestarts <- df_carstart %>% distinct(givenevent, uniquecode, .keep_all = TRUE)
df_uniqueends <- df_carend %>% distinct(givenevent, uniquecode, .keep_all = TRUE)

#df of just events that are to be filtered out for being anything but the first instance
#(Note: this step isn't strictly necessary, but I wanted to keep a separate record of exclusions)
df_scoredupes <- df_scores[!df_scores$rowid %in% df_uniquescores$rowid,]
df_startdupes <- df_carstart[!df_carstart$rowid %in% df_uniquestarts$rowid,]
df_enddupes <- df_carend[!df_carend$rowid %in% df_uniqueends$rowid,]

#removing the filter df from the main df
df <- df[!df$rowid %in% df_scoredupes$rowid,]
df <- df[!df$rowid %in% df_startdupes$rowid,]
df <- df[!df$rowid %in% df_enddupes$rowid,]

#exclude all trials where subs didn't have all of the critical three (car start, score, car end)
df <- df[df$uniquecode %in% df_scores$uniquecode,]
df <- df[df$uniquecode %in% df_carstart$uniquecode,]
df <- df[df$uniquecode %in% df_carend$uniquecode,]
```
#### Spams and Whiffs
Averages for trials where participants spammed space or missed the car entirely.

```{r missedtrials, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

  group_by(subcondition, block) %>%
  summarise(AverageExtraSpacePresses = mean(SpacePresses)) %>% 
  kable(., digits = 2, caption = "Average number of additional space presses")

#trials where the subject failed to press space
df_scores %>% 
  filter(response == 10 | response == 20 | response == 30) %>%
  select(id, subcondition, block, trial, response) %>% 
  mutate(misses = as.numeric(trial) - 10) %>%

  group_by(subcondition, block) %>% 
  summarise(AverageTrialsMissed = mean(misses)) %>% 
  kable(., digits = 2, caption = "Average number of trials subject failed to wave the car")
```

```{r RTs, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
JustRTs <- df %>% 
  filter(givenevent == "Score (Space Pressed)" | givenevent == "Car Starts") %>% 
  arrange(rowid) %>% #done to make sure everything is absolutely in chronological order
  mutate(timesincecarstart = timenow - lag(timenow, default = first(timenow))) %>% 
  filter(givenevent == "Score (Space Pressed)" & timesincecarstart < 10) #filters out RT outliers due to trial gaps
```

```

### Speed Estimates (Threat *Distortion*)
**Description**: The car speeds in the raw data reflect the time needed to travel 250 units (unit = approx 1ft). This is why they don't read as 30-70 mph in the raw output. In the pilot data, I used to relabel these levels, but I don't anymore since the speeds now are being measured as likert responses. In other words, I cannot compare estimate speed to actual speed anymore, but rather I can only compare between conditions.

*Hidden code*: To describe the following

* Double check that estimated speeds weren't collected more than once per trial (e.g. in a double-recording event due to recording lag)

####Average Speed Estimates
```{r isolatingtrueestimates, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_estimates <- df %>% filter(givenevent == "Estimated Speed")
df_uniqueests <- df_estimates %>% distinct(givenevent, uniquecode, .keep_all = TRUE)
df_estdupes <- df_estimates[!df_estimates$rowid %in% df_uniqueests$rowid,]
df <- df[!df$rowid %in% df_estdupes$rowid,]
df <- df[df$uniquecode %in% df_estimates$uniquecode,]
```

  ggtitle("Distribution of Speed Estimates Overlap Between Conditions")

```


#### Stimuli checks
**Description**:Code to look at how the actual stim presentation compared to the intended programmed presentation
 
*Hidden code*: To describe the following

* Comparing presentation speed to programmed speed
* Collapsing the likert range to correspond to speed range

```{r actualspeed, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#special test to figure out if timing events actually match car speeds (comment out when not in use)
#there are 258.81 ft in the car path (258.81 ft/s = 176 mph)
#dividing the ft/s speed (carspeed) by 1.467 should equal the mph speed
#258/timesincecarstart  / 1.467 = carspeed? lets test
df$programmedMPH <- recode(df$carspeed, "44"="30", "59"="40", "73"="50", "88"="60", "103"="70")
stim_pres_check <- df %>% filter(givenevent == "Car Ends" | givenevent == "Car Starts") %>% 
  arrange(rowid) %>% 
  mutate(timesincecarstart = timenow - lag(timenow, default = first(timenow))) %>%  
  mutate(msmph = (258/timesincecarstart)/1.467) %>% filter(givenevent == "Car Ends")

ggplot(stim_pres_check, aes(x = msmph, fill=programmedMPH)) + geom_density(alpha=0.50) + xlim(list=c(25,75)) +
  ylab("MPH based on actual timing logs") + xlab("MPH based on programmed speed")

```

```{r Speederror, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#need to get likert ratings from JustSpeeds to stim_pres_check
for(i in 1:dim(stim_pres_check[1])){
  for(j in 1:dim(JustSpeeds[1])){
    if(stim_pres_check$uniquecode[i] == JustSpeeds$uniquecode[j]){
      stim_pres_check$response[i] = JustSpeeds$response[j] 
    }
  }
}

#let's collapse the extreme responses
stim_pres_check$CollapsedLikertRating <- recode(stim_pres_check$response, "1" = "1. Very Slow", "2" = "1. Very Slow", "3"="2. Slow", "4"="3. Neither Fast/Slow", "5" = "4. Fast", "6"= "5. Very Fast", "7"= "5. Very Fast")
ggplot(stim_pres_check, aes(x = msmph, y = CollapsedLikertRating, fill=CollapsedLikertRating)) + geom_density_ridges(alpha=0.50) + xlim(list=c(25,75)) +
  xlab("MPH based on actual timing logs") + facet_wrap(~subcondition)
```
**Summary**: Speeds degraded the faster the car was intended to be. This variation was likely introduced due to resolution and fps variation. Subject accuracy in speed estimates reflects psychophysics literature -- participants are less accurate with increasing speed magnitudes.


### Picking up baby
**Description**: Code to look at how often participants picked up the baby and where the baby was when they did. Notably, I had to make sure these events extended beyond those that were filtered for not being "true trials".
```{r Bpresses, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_pretrues %>% filter(givenevent == "B Pressed") %>% 
  #need to eliminate duplicates when they press space more than once
  group_by(babylocation, subcondition) %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  kable(., digits = 2, caption = "Total B presses")

numberB <- df_pretrues %>% filter(givenevent == "B Pressed") %>% 
  #need to eliminate duplicates when they press space more than once
  group_by(id, babylocation, subcondition) %>% summarize(count = n()) 
  
numberB %>% group_by(subcondition) %>% summarize("Average" = mean(count)) %>% 
  kable(., digits = 2, caption = "Average B presses per subject across parental status")
numberB %>% group_by(babylocation) %>% summarize("Average B Presses Per Subject" = mean(count)) %>% 
  kable(., digits = 2, caption = "Average B presses per subject across baby location")

```
Were B preses significantly predicted by location?
```{r Bpressessig, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lm_Bpress <- lm(count ~ babylocation, data=numberB)
emmeans(lm_Bpress, "babylocation", contr = "pairwise", infer =TRUE)$contrast %>% 
  kable(., digit=2, caption = "Difference in Average No. of B Presses")

```



## Significance Tests

### Parents vs. NonParents on Threat *Detection*
**Description**: Regression model where RT is predicted by interaction of trial block and parental status including random effects of block and ID.

```{r RTtest, include=TRUE, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lm_RT <- lmer(timesincecarstart ~ block * subcondition + (1 | id), data = JustRTs)
```

```{r RTtestemmeans, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
emmeans(lm_RT, "block", contr = "pairwise", infer =TRUE)$contrast %>% 
  kable(., digit=3, caption = "Average effect of block")
emmeans(lm_RT, "subcondition", contr = "pairwise", infer =TRUE)$contrast %>% 
  kable(., digit=3, caption = "Average effect of parental status")
emmeans(lm_RT, "block", by="subcondition", contr="pairwise", infer=TRUE)$contrast %>% 
  kable(., digit=3, caption = "Difference in block estimates by parental status")

ref_RT <- ref_grid(lm_RT,at=list(timesincecarstart=c(0,1)))
contrast(ref_RT, interaction = "pairwise") %>%

```

**Summary**: Potential interaction. There was a significant difference between block 2 and 3 and the effect is driven by the Parent group. P values and CIs for the parent vs. nonparent contrast is worth keeping an eye on.

#### Non-Parametric Follow-up
It's interesting how there appears to be a patter of greater absolute change among parents. Let's test!

*Hidden code* the following steps were taken to prepare the data:

* create new columns: (block 2-1) and (block 3-2)
* get absolute magnitude (slope magnitude; t-test)
* assess in binary "is block#-# smaller/larger than 0?" (sign test; chi-sq)

```{r RTNP, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

  mutate(Diff2to3 = block3 - block2) %>%
