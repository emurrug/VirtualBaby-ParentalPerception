//FILE README (Emma's notes)

//05.14.2020 this file is divided into 2 parts: 
//1. connection to the MySQL database and 
//2. instances (listed as variables) that will trigger data collection in the script

//this file contains code for interfacing directly with the web-hosted server database
//in short, I have included the essentials: opening, accessing, inserting into, and closing the database
//I decided to omit other basic code like updating and deleting rows within the database --
//This was because I figured it would be best to download the data in longform (to obtain multiple timestamps)
// and not overwrite entries based on a single variable.

//the server is currently being hosted (for free) on AWS. Below are all the credentials needed to access 
//the MySQL database from a product like 'MySQL Workbench'. This is where I am currently working to 
//select, modify, and delete data if I need to (such as for test runs). 
//It is also essential to have 'MySQL Connector' in order to link the C# script in Unity to a SQL database. 
//I did it this way so each game instance connects directly with the dedicated server (instead of having a localhost server).

//05.15.2020 the only way to run this is by adding the .DLL reference "MySql.Data"
//directly to the 'Assets' library. This can be downloaded online, but it MUST be vers. 6.9.8.0 
//to be compatible with the .NET connector
